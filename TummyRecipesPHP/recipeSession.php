                            and a cheese sauce, usually cheddar. 
                            Other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat, can be added.
                            <br><br>
                            Traditional macaroni and cheese is baked in a casserole, 
                            but it can also be made in a sauce pan on the stovetop or using a prepackaged mix. 
                            The cheese is usually mixed with a Béchamel sauce to make a Mornay sauce 
                            before being put to the pasta. It is considered a comfort dish in the United States.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>Carbonara is a pasta dish prepared with eggs, 
                            hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper that originated in Rome. 
                            In the middle of the twentieth century, the dish took on its modern form, 
                            with its current name.
                            <br><br>
                            Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a blend of the two is usually used. 
                            The most prevalent pasta is spaghetti, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, 
                            and bucatini are also popular. The meat component is usually guanciale or pancetta, 
                            but lardons of smoked bacon are a popular replacement outside of Italy.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;"><br>Lasagna is a form of pasta made of very wide, 
                            flat sheets that is possibly one of the oldest. Alternatively, either phrase can 
                            refer to an Italian dish consisting of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with 
                            fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses 
                            (including ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices such as garlic, 
                            oregano, and basil.
                            <br><br>
                            Grated cheese, which melts after baking, can be sprinkled on top of the dish. 
                            Cooked pasta is usually mixed with the remaining ingredients and baked in the oven. 
                            The casserole is then divided into single-serving square portions.

                            shrimp fried rice is always one of the most popular fried rice meals. 
                            Fried rice is typically dark brown in color, due to a combination of dark 
                            and light soy sauce and thick soy sauce, or yellow in color, 
                            due to the use of food coloring as a color agent, giving fried rice its recognizable 
                            light yellow tint.
                            <br><br>
                            While some use a combination of soy sauces and turmeric to generate a natural color and 
                            flavor balance that somehow manages to make the rice taste even better!
